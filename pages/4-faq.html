    <h2>Q: Any plans for physical releases? (LP, CD, MC):</h2>
    <h2>A: Yes! That is our dream! But, money is tight. We'll see what happens next. For full transparency, we will be prioritizing MCs and maybe CDs at the same time as
        they're more accessible financially. And then LPs if money is cool.
    </h2> <br/><br/>

    <h2>Q: Why does your website look awful?</h2>
    <h2>A: I know. My skills are kinda bad, and websites like <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">this</a> give me inspiration for the design.
    I just like the simple design, and just gets the point across. You probably wont need anymore anyway, especially since info is the main purpose of this website.</h2> <br/><br/>

    <h2>Q: Can I get signed?</h2>
    <h2>A: I wish you could cause that would be really cool, but unfortunately not for now or in the foreseeable future. Finances, legal knowledge, knowledge about running a label, and connections are all things this label and I are lacking, and this will most likely cause you issues.
         I think it would be best for you to get signed onto a label that at least knows what they're doing. I'm sorry that this sounds super elitist and gatekeepy. I hope all of this
         can change one day. <br/><br/>

         The people that may get signed onto here will most likely be close friends and family that enjoy the novelty rather than the money.
    </h2> <br/><br/>

    <h2>Q: Who are you when you say "I" and "me"?</h2>
    <h2>A: Wilson. Sorry, I'm the only person available since... I'm the only person on the label as of writing this lmao</h2>
