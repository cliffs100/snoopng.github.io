    <h2>Q: Any plans for physical releases? (LP, CD, MC):</h2>
    <h2>A: Yes! But the money needed exceeds the amount we have.</h2> <br/><br/>

    <h2>Q: This wesbite looks like garbage.</h2>
    <h2>A: We know. We don't have the best skills, and websites like <a target="_blank" href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">this</a> give us inspiration for the design.
    We, or at least some of us, just like the simple design, and just gets the point across. You probably wont need anymore anyway, especially since info is the main purpose of this website.</h2> <br/><br/>

    <h2>Q: Can I get signed?</h2>
    <h2>A: I wish you could cause that would be really cool, but unfortunately not for now or in the foreseeable future. Finances, legal knowledge, knowledge about running a label, and connections are all things this label and I are lacking, and this will most likely cause you issues.
         I think it would be best for you to get signed onto a label that at least knows what they're doing. I'm sorry that this sounds super elitist and gatekeepy. I hope all of this
         can change one day. <br/><br/>

         The people that may get on here will most likely be close friends and family, since we're mostly going to be messing around.
    </h2> <br/><br/>

    <h2>Q: Who are you when you say "I" and "me"?</h2>
    <h2>A: Wilson. Sorry, I'm the only person available currently to write this page. (lmao)</h2><br/><br/>

    <h2>Q: How do I contact you guys?</h2>
    <h2>A: You can't right now.</h2>
