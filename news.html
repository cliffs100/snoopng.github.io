    <h3>Sooo this is technically old news, but whatever. Wilson (Genuine3106) has made a song. Although kind of lazy and bad, it's the first real release of any artist on this record label!
    <br/><br/>What Wilson says: <em>Created for an English project, but made to express what I think it would sound like to experience pure happiness. Mixing has a lot to be desired and some melodies might sound a bit strange. I sort of like the current mixing, but it may cause problems on small speakers. As for the melody, if only I knew music theory.</em>
